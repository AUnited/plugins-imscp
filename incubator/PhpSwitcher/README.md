## Plugin configuration

### Setup new PHP version

At first, you must download, configure, compile and install the PHP version which you want make available for your
customers. You can either process manually or by using the PHP compiler which is shipped with the plugin ( see below ).

#### PHP compiler

The PHP compiler is a script that allows to download, configure, compile and install one or many PHP versions in one step.
The script is available in the **PhpSwitcher/PhpCompiler** directory.

For instance, if you want to install the **php-5.3** version, you can run the script as follow:
 
 ```shell
 # perl /var/www/imscp/gui/plugins/PhpSwitcher/PhpCompiler/php_compiler.pl php-5.3
 ```

Or if you want install all PHP versions which can be compiled by this script, you can run it as follow:

```shell
# perl /var/www/imscp/gui/plugins/PhpSwitcher/PhpCompiler/php_compiler.pl all
```

Supported PHP versions are: **php-5.2**, **php-5.3**, **php-5.4**, **php-5.5** and **php-5.6**.

By default, the script will build new PHP versions into the **/usr/local/src/phpswitcher** directory and install them in
the **/opt/phpswitcher** directory but you can change this behavior by using command line options.

To get more information about available command line options, you can run:

```shell
# perl /var/www/imscp/gui/plugins/PhpSwitcher/PhpCompiler/php_compiler.pl --help
```

#### Registration through PhpSwitcher

1. Login into the panel as administrator and go to the PhpSwitcher interface ( settings section )
2. Create a new PHP version with the following parameters:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Parameter</th>
		<th>Value</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Name</td>
		<td>PHP-5.3 (Fcgid)</td>
		<td>This is the unique name for the new PHP version</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PHP binary path</td>
		<td>/opt/phpswitcher/php-5.3/bin/php-cgi</td>
		<td>This is the path of the PHP binary</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>PHP configuration directory</td>
		<td>/var/www/fcgi</td>
		<td>This is the directory in which customers's PHP configuration files will be stored</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Once it's done and if all goes well, your customers should be able to switch to this new PHP version using their own
PhpSwitcher interface, which is available in the **Domains** section.

1. Be sure that all requirements as stated in the requirements section are meets
2. Backup your plugin configuration file if needed
3. Upload the plugin through the plugin management interface
4. Restore your plugin configuration file if needed ( compare it with the new version first )
5. Update the plugin list through the plugin management interface

#### Memcached configuration parameters

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Parameter</th>
