### HOWTO SETUP NEW PHP VERSION

At first, you must get, compile and install the PHP version which you want make available for your customers. For instance,
if you want add PHP5.3 as a FastCGI application (Fcgid), you can follow these steps on Debian Wheezy (X86_64 arch):

#### Creating build environment

	# cd /usr/local/src
	# mkdir -p php_buildenv/php53 && cd php_buildenv/php53
	# mkdir -p /opt/php-fcgid/5.3
	# apt-get update && apt-get install build-essential

#### Installing needed libraries

	# apt-get build-dep php5
	# apt-get install libfcgi-dev libfcgi0ldbl libjpeg62-dbg libmcrypt-dev libssl-dev libc-client2007e \
	libc-client2007e-dev libpq5

	# Needed on X86_64 arch only
	# ln -s /usr/lib/libc-client.a /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-client.a

#### Fetching PHP sources

	# wget http://au1.php.net/get/php-5.3.28.tar.bz2/from/this/mirror -O php.tar.bz2
	# tar jxf php.tar.bz2
	# cd php-5.3.28

#### Configuration

	# ./configure --prefix=/opt/php-fcgid/5.3 --with-pdo-pgsql --with-zlib-dir --with-freetype-dir --enable-mbstring \
	--with-libxml-dir=/usr --enable-soap --enable-calendar --with-curl --with-mcrypt --with-zlib --with-gd \
	--with-pgsql --disable-rpath --enable-inline-optimization --with-bz2 --with-zlib --enable-sockets \
	--enable-sysvsem --enable-sysvshm --enable-pcntl --enable-mbregex --enable-exif --enable-bcmath --with-mhash \
	--enable-zip --with-pcre-regex --with-mysql=mysqlnd --with-pdo-mysql=mysqlnd --with-mysqli=mysqlnd \
	--with-mysql-sock=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock --with-jpeg-dir=/usr --with-png-dir=/usr --enable-gd-native-ttf \
	--with-openssl --with-libdir=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu --enable-ftp --with-imap --with-imap-ssl --with-kerberos \
	--with-gettext --with-xmlrpc --with-xsl --enable-cgi

**Note:** If you need more modules, you must tune the configuration options and install needed libraries.

#### Compilation and installation

	# make
	# make install

#### Checking

Test your php binary by running the following command:

	# /opt/php-fcgid/5.3/bin/php-cgi -v

which should give the following result:

	PHP 5.3.28 (cgi-fcgi) (built: Feb 20 2014 18:02:14)
	Copyright (c) 1997-2013 The PHP Group
	Zend Engine v2.3.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2013 Zend Technologies

### Registration through PhpSwitcher

	# Login into the panel as administrator and go to the PhpSwitcher interface
	# Create a new PHP version with the following parameters:

		**Name:** PHP5.3 (Fcgid)
		**PHP binary path:** /opt/php-fcgid/5.3/bin/php-cgi
		**PHP configuration directory:** /var/www/fcgi

Once it's done and if all goes well, your customers should be able to switch to this new PHP version using their own
PhpSwitcher interface, which is available in the 'Domains' section.

### TROUBLESHOOTINGS

If you are currently running MariaDB on your server, you'll surely have some package dependencie problems while trying
to install PHP build package dependencies. In such case, you must temporary switch to the MySQL version as provided by
your distribution.
