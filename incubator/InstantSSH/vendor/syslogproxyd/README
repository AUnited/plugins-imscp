Updated for Version 0.3 release of syslogproxyd 17 Mar 2012

copyright (c) Martin Crossley 2011, 2012

These archives are snapshots of the initial and subsequent releases of the project source code (primarily as a safety backup).
The most up-to-date version of the code is always that in the GIT repository (click on 'code' in the project's sourceforge page).
If you want to build from the snapshot, just compile and link all the .c files together :-)

From V0.3 onwards, the build environment has been converted to use GNU autotools.
You should therefore now be able to build the project by the usual process of running 'configure' followed by 'make'.

The usage instructions (available from the command line by using the '--help' option) are as follows:

	syslogproxyd [options] <input_path> [<output_path>]
	
	options:
		-a <path>	 	--input <path>		create additional input socket(s) - may appear multiple times
		-d				--foreground		remain foreground and log to stderr
		-V <0-9>		--verbosity <0-9>	set reporting level (default 5)
		-?				--help				this message
		-v[v[..]]		--verbose			increase verbosity
		-q[q[..]]		--quiet				reduce verbosity
		-n				--no_validation		switch off RFC 3164 message validation
		-u <username>	--user <username>	run as different user (requires root)
		-g <groupname>	--group <groupname>	run as different group (requires root)
		-p <file>		--pidfile <file>	alternate location to store PID (default /var/run/syslogproxyd.pid)
	
	default destination: /dev/log
