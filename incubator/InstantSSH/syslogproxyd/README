These archives are snapshots of the initial and subsequent releases of the project source code (primarily as a safety backup).
The most up-to-date version of the code is always that in the GIT repository (click on 'code' in the project's sourceforge page).
If you want to build from the snapshot, just compile and link all the .c files together :-)

From V0.3 onwards, the build environment has been converted to use GNU autotools.
You should therefore now be able to build the project by the usual process of running 'configure' followed by 'make'.

The usage instructions are available from the command line by using the '--help' option.
