##Â i-MSCP InstantSSH plugin v0.0.3

Plugin allowing to provide full SSH access to customers.

### Introduction

This plugin allow to give your customers a full SSH access by allowing them to add their SSH keys in i-MSCP. This plugin
doesn't provide a secured shell environment such as jailkit. Therefore, customers to which an SSH access is given must
be trusted even if they are restricted in their actions. For the same reason, no reseller interface is provided at this
moment. Thus, SSH permissions can be added only through the admin interface.

For each customer, you can set the maximum number of allowed SSH keys, and choose if they can override the default
authentication options. The authentication options are those specified in the documentation of the authorized_keys file
(see man authorized_keys).

Default authentication options are set as follow:

	no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding

which in order:

* Forbids authentication agent forwarding
* Forbids TCP forwarding
* Forbids X11 forwarding

You can override default authentication options by editing the **default_ssh_auth_options** parameter which is defined
in the plugin configuration file. In that file, you can also restrict the list of authentication options that your
customers can add by editing the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** parameter. You must note that any authentication option
appearing in the the default authentication string must also be specified in the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** parameter.
