### INTRODUCTION

This plugin allow to give your customers a full SSH access by allowing them to add their SSH keys in i-MSCP. This plugin
doesn't provide a secured shell environment such as jailkit. Thus, customers to which an SSH access is given must be
trusted even if they are restricted in their actions. For the same reason, no reseller interface is provided at this
moment. Thus, SSH permissions can be added only through the admin interface.

For each customer, you can set the maximum number of allowed SSH keys and choose if he can override the default SSH key
options which are defined in the plugin configuration file.

SSH key options which are allowed are those specified in the authorized_keys file documentation (see man authorized_keys).
You must be aware that while the SSH keys validity is checked, no test is made for the SSH key options. Therefore,
customers which are allowed to override the SSH key options must know what they are doing.

Default SSH key options are set as follow:

	no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding

which in order:

* Forbids authentication agent forwarding
* Forbids TCP forwarding
* Forbids X11 forwarding

You can override default SSH key options by editing the plugin configuration file.
