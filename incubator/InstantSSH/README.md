##Â i-MSCP InstantSSH plugin v2.0.1

Plugin allowing to provide full or jailed shell access to your customers.

### Introduction

This plugin allow to give your customers a full or jailed shell access.

A customer to which SSH permissions are given can add its own SSH keys and use them to authenticate on the server.

For each customer, you can set the maximum number of allowed SSH keys and choose if they can override the default
authentication options. The authentication options are those specified in the documentation of the authorized_keys file
(see man authorized_keys).

Default authentication options are set as follow:

	no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding

which in order:

* Forbids authentication agent forwarding
* Forbids TCP forwarding
* Forbids X11 forwarding

You can override default authentication options by editing the **default_ssh_auth_options** option which is defined in
the plugin configuration file. In that file, you can also restrict the list of authentication options that your
customers can add by editing the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** option. You must note that any authentication option
appearing in the the default authentication string must also be specified in the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** option.

#### Jailed shells

The Jailed shells allow you to provide SSH access to your customers in a secured and restricted environment from which
they can theorically not escape. It's the preferable way to give an SSH access to an un-trusted customer.

Several commands can be added into the jails by simply adding the needed application sections into the **app_sections**
configuration option.

The default configuration comes with a set of preselected application sections which allow to setup a very restricted
jailed shell environment. This environment is setup by using busybox which combines tiny versions of many common UNIX
utilities into a single small executable.

See the plugin **config.php** file for further details.

### Plugin usage

The development of this plugin took me a lot of time, especially the Jailbuilder layer which allows to build the jailed
shell environments. Thus, I would ask a small contribution for use of this plugin by doing a donation on my paypal
account ( paypal@nuxwin.com ). If you don't understand such asks, or if you do not want donate, just don't use this
plugin.

### Requirements

* i-MSCP >= 1.1.14 (plugin API >= 0.2.11)
* openSSH server with public key authentication support enabled

#### Debian / Ubuntu packages

* busybox
* libpam-chroot
* makejail

You can install these packages by executing the following commands:

	# aptitude update
	# aptitude install busybox libpam-chroot makejail

**Notes**
  - If a package is not installed on your system, the plugin installer throws an error
  - If you have any problem with the PAM chroot module read the **Troubleshooting** section below

### Installation

1. Login into the panel as admin and go to the plugin management interface
2. Upload the **InstantSSH** plugin archive
3. Activate the plugin

### Update

1. Be sure that all required packages as mentioned in the requirements section are installed on your system
2. Backup your current config file **plugins/InstantSSH/config.php**
3. Login into the panel as admin and go to the plugin management interface
4. Upload the **InstantSSH** plugin archive
5. Restore your **plugins/InstantSSH/config.php** (compare it with the new version first)
6. Click on the **Update Plugins** button in the plugin management interface

### Troubleshooting

#### PAM chroot module

The **PAM chroot** module shipped with some libpam-chroot package versions (eg. Ubuntu Lucid) doesn't work as expected.
For instance, You can see the following logs in the /var/log/auth.log file:

	...
	Oct 13 21:04:31 lucid sshd[1509]: PAM unable to dlopen(/lib/security/pam_chroot.so): /lib/security/pam_chroot.so: undefined symbol: __stack_chk_fail_local
	Oct 13 21:04:31 lucid sshd[1509]: PAM adding faulty module: /lib/security/pam_chroot.so
	...

You can fix this easily by following this procedure:

	# cd /usr/local/src
	# mkdir libpam-chroot && cd libpam-chroot
	# apt-get install build-essential debhelper libpam0g-dev
	# apt-get source libpam-chroot
	# cd libpam-chroot*

Edit the **Makefile** file to replace the line:

	CFLAGS=-fPIC -O2 -Wall -Werror -pedantic

by

	CFLAGS=-fPIC -O2 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -fno-stack-protector

Rebuild and reinstall the package as follow:

	# dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
	# cd ..
	# dpkg -i dpkg -i libpam-chroot*.deb
