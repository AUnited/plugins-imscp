##Â i-MSCP InstantSSH plugin v2.1.0

Plugin allowing to provide full or restricted shell access to your customers.

### Introduction

This plugin allow to give your customers a full or restricted shell access.

A customer to which SSH permissions are given can add its own SSH keys and use them to authenticate on the server.

For each customer, you can set the maximum number of allowed SSH keys and choose if they can override the default
authentication options. The authentication options are those specified in the documentation of the authorized_keys file
(see man authorized_keys).

Default authentication options are set as follow:

	no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding

which in order:

* Forbids authentication agent forwarding
* Forbids TCP forwarding
* Forbids X11 forwarding

You can override default authentication options by editing the **default_ssh_auth_options** option which is defined in
the plugin configuration file. In that file, you can also restrict the list of authentication options that your
customers can add by editing the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** option. You must note that any authentication option
appearing in the the default authentication string must also be specified in the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** option.

#### Jailed shells

The Jailed shells allow you to provide SSH access to your customers in a secured and restricted environment from which
they can theorically not escape. It's the preferable way to give an SSH access to an un-trusted customer.

Several commands can be added into the jails by simply adding the needed application sections into the **app_sections**
configuration option.

The default configuration comes with a set of preselected application sections which allow to setup a very restricted
jailed shell environment. This environment is setup by using busybox which combines tiny versions of many common UNIX
utilities into a single small executable.

See the plugin **config.php** file for further details.

### Requirements

### Translations

Since version **2.0.1**, this plugin can be translated in your language using a simple PHP file which return an array of
translation strings. In order, to translate this plugin in your language, you must:
 
1. Create a new translation file for your language (eg. de_DE.php) in the **plugins/InstantSSH/l10n** directory by
copying the **en_GB.php* file ( only if the file doesn't exist yet ). The file must be UTF-8 encoded.
2. Translate the strings (The keys are the msgid strings and the values the msgstr strings). You must only translate the
msgstr strings.

During your translation session, you must enable the **DEBUG** mode in the **/etc/imscp/imscp.conf** file to force reload
of the translation files on each request, else, the translation strings are put in cache. Don't forget to disable it once
you have finished to translate.

You're welcome to submit your translation files in our forum if you want see them integrated in the later release.

### Troubleshootings

#### PAM chroot module

The **PAM chroot** module shipped with some libpam-chroot package versions (eg. Ubuntu Lucid) doesn't work as expected.
For instance, You can see the following logs in the /var/log/auth.log file:

	...
	Oct 13 21:04:31 lucid sshd[1509]: PAM unable to dlopen(/lib/security/pam_chroot.so): /lib/security/pam_chroot.so: undefined symbol: __stack_chk_fail_local
	Oct 13 21:04:31 lucid sshd[1509]: PAM adding faulty module: /lib/security/pam_chroot.so
	...

You can fix this easily by following this procedure:

	# cd /usr/local/src
	# mkdir libpam-chroot && cd libpam-chroot
	# apt-get install build-essential debhelper libpam0g-dev
	# apt-get source libpam-chroot
	# cd libpam-chroot*

Edit the **Makefile** file to replace the line:

	CFLAGS=-fPIC -O2 -Wall -Werror -pedantic

by

	CFLAGS=-fPIC -O2 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -fno-stack-protector

Rebuild and reinstall the package as follow:

	# dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
	# cd ..
	# dpkg -i libpam-chroot*.deb

### Plugin usage

The development of this plugin took me a lot of time, especially the Jailbuilder layer which allows to build the jailed
shell environments. Thus, I would ask a small contribution for use of this plugin by doing a donation on my paypal
account ( paypal@nuxwin.com ). If you don't understand such asks, or if you do not want donate, just don't use this
plugin.
