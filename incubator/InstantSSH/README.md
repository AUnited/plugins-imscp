##Â i-MSCP InstantSSH plugin v2.0.0

Plugin allowing to provide full or restricted SSH access to your customers.

### Introduction

This plugin allow to give your customers a full or restricted SSH access (jailed shell). A customer to which SSH
permissions are given can add its own SSH keys  and use them to authenticate on the server.

For each customer, you can set the maximum number of allowed SSH keys and choose if they can override the default
authentication options. The authentication options are those specified in the documentation of the authorized_keys file
(see man authorized_keys).

Default authentication options are set as follow:

	no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding

which in order:

* Forbids authentication agent forwarding
* Forbids TCP forwarding
* Forbids X11 forwarding

You can override default authentication options by editing the **default_ssh_auth_options** option which is defined in
the plugin configuration file. In that file, you can also restrict the list of authentication options that your
customers can add by editing the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** option. You must note that any authentication option
appearing in the the default authentication string must also be specified in the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** option.

#### Jailed shell

Jailed shell allow you to provide SSH access to your customers in a secured and restricted environment from which they
cannot out. It's the preferable way to give an SSH access to an un-trusted customer.

Several commands can be added into the customers jails by simply adding the needed application sections into the
**app_sections configuration option**. See the plugin configuration file for further details.
