#Â i-MSCP cronjobs plugin v1.0.0

WARNING: This plugin is still under development, not ready for use

## Introduction

This plugin provide a cron time-based job scheduler for i-MSCP. 

Administrators give cron permissions to their resellers, and the resellers give the cron permissions to their customers
according their own permissions. For instance, a reseller will be able to give the full cron permission to a customer
only if he has also this permission.

Administrators can also add their own cron jobs using their own interface which is less restricted than the customer
interface in the sense that they can set the UNIX user to use for the cron job execution while the customers cannot.

Each cron job is added in the crontab file ( see crontab(5) ) that belongs to the UNIX user under which the cron command
must be run. For customers, this is the Web user as created by i-MSCP.

## Requirements

* i-MSCP >= 1.1.21 ( plugin API >= 0.2.15 )

### Requirements for jailed cron jobs support

You can install this package by executing the following command:

	# aptitude install libpam-chroot msmtp

## Cron job types

Three types of cron jobs are available, which are in order: **URL**, **Jailed** and **Full**.

### URL

The URL cron jobs are always available. They allow to schedule URL commands executed via GNU Wget. The commands must be
valid HTTP(s) URLs.

**Note:** When a customer has permission for jailed cron jobs, the URL cron jobs are run inside the jailed environment,
else they are run outside the jailed environment. This is by design, and this do not change anything from the customer
point of view.
 
### Jailed

The jailed cron jobs allow to schedule commands which are run through the shell interpreter in a jailed environment.
By default the plugin will create a jailed environment which provides:

* GNU Wget
* PHP (CLI) and some PHP modules ( mysqlnd, pdo, gd, intl, json, mcrypt, mysql, mysqli, pdo_mysql, readline )
* Mysql monitor and mysqldump
* A set of common UNIX utilities

**Note:** Only one jailed environment is created for all jailed cron jobs. The most important here, is that the cron
jobs cannot broke the whole system.

#### Availability

The jailed cron jobs are available only when the [InstantSSH](../InstantSSH/README.md) plugin is also present on the
system, whatever it is activated or not. The CronJobs plugin reuses the jail builder library which is provided by the
InstantSSH plugin to manage the jailed environment.

The jailed cron jobs doesn't apply to administrators.

### Full

The full cron jobs are identical to the jailed cron jobs, excepted the fact that the commands are not run inside a
jailed environment. Such cron jobs should be reserved to trusted users.

## Crontab files

The plugin handles the crontab files automatically. You must note that any manual change made in a crontab file which is
under the control of this plugin will be automatically overriden on next processing. Therefore, once that a crontab file
is under the control of this plugin, you must use the cron jobs interface provided by this plugin to add, edit or delete
a cron job in this file.

A crontab file is under the control of this plugin as soon as you add a cron task for the user to which it belong to,
through the cron jobs interface provided by this plugin.

## Interfaces access

### Cron permissions interfaces

* Administrators can access their cron permissions interface through the **Settings** menu
* Resellers can access their cron permissions interface through the **Customers** menu

### Cron jobs interfaces

* Administrators can access their cron jobs interface through the **System tools** menu
* Customers can access their cron jobs interface through the **Webtools** menu

## Translation

You can translate this plugin by copying the [l10n/en_GB.php](l10n/en_GB.php) language file, and by translating all the
array values inside the new file.
