#Â i-mscp cronjobs plugin v0.0.1

plugin providing a cron time-based job scheduler for i-MSCP.

WARNING: This plugin is still under development, not ready for use

## Introduction

This plugin provide a cron time-based job scheduler for i-MSCP. Administrators give cron permissions to their resellers,
and the resellers give cron permissions to their customers according their own permissions. This is a cascading permissions
system. For instance, a reseller will be able to give the full cronjob permission to a customer only if he has also this
permission.

### Cronjob types

Three types of cronjobs are available, which are in order: **Url**, **Jailed** and **Full**.

The jailed cronjob type is available and functional only when the InstantSSH plugin is also present on the system. Thus,
this is a pre-requirement for use of jailed cronjobs feature.

#### Url

This type of cronjob allow to schedule commands executed using GNU Wget. The commands must be a valid HTTP URL.

#### Jailed

This type of  cronjob allow to schedule commands which are run through /bin/sh, in a jailed environment. Thus, any needed
binary should be available inside the jail, else, the commands will fail. By default the plugin will create a jailed
environment which provides Perl, PHP and the common UNIX utilities as provided by BusyBox.

Only one jailed environment is created for all jailed cronjobs. This is by design. The most important thing here is that
the cronjob cannot warn the whole system. This is not like for jailed shell where it's sometime more convenient to have
a jail per customer.

#### Full

This type of cronjob is identical to the jailed cronjob, excepted the fact that the commands are not run in a jailed
environment.

## Plugin usage

the development of this plugin took me a lot of time. Thus, I would ask a small contribution for use of this plugin by
