#Â i-MSCP cronjobs plugin v0.0.1

WARNING: This plugin is still under development, not ready for use

## Introduction

This plugin provide a cron time-based job scheduler for i-MSCP. 

The administrators give cron job permissions to their resellers, and the resellers give the cronjob permissions to their
customers according their own permissions. For instance, a reseller will be able to give the full cron job permission to
a customer only if he has also this permission.

The administrators can also add their own cron jobs using their own interface which is less restricted than the customer
interface in the sense that administrators can set the user to use for the cron job execution while the customers cannot.

Each cron jobs is added in the crontab file ( see crontab(5) ) which belongs to the user under which the cron command
must be run.

## Requirements

* i-MSCP >= 1.1.19 ( plugin API >= 0.2.14 )
* InstantSSH plugin >= 3.1.0 ( only if you want enable support for jailed cron jobs )

**Note:** The activation of the InstantSSH plugin is not mandatory to enable support for jailed cron jobs. Only its
presence is required. If this plugin is already activated and if you want enable support for jailed cron jobs later on,
just upload the InstantSSH plugin and once it's done, deactivate and reactivate this plugin. You must note that once
enabled, support for the jailed cron jobs cannot be disabled and thus, deletion of the InstantSSH plugin is prohibited.

### Cron job types

Three types of cron jobs are available, which are in order: **Url**, **Jailed** and **Full**.

#### Url

The Url cron jobs allow to schedule commands executed using GNU Wget. The commands must be a valid HTTP(s) URL.

This cron job type is always available. When the full cron jobs type is selected, the URL cron jobs are run using the
wget command from the system, else, they are run using the wget command from the jailed environment.

#### Jailed

The jailed cron jobs allow to schedule commands which are run through **/bin/sh** in a jailed environment. By default
the plugin will create a jailed environment which provides:

* GNU Wget
* PHP (CLI) and some modules (mysqlnd, pdo, gd, intl, json, mcrypt, mysql, mysqli, pdo_mysql, readline)
* Mysql Monitor and mysqldump
* A set of common UNIX utilities

Only one jailed environment is created for all jailed cron jobs. This is by design. The most important here, is that the
cron jobs cannot broke the whole system.

##### Availability

The jailed cron jobs are available only when the [InstantSSH](../InstantSSH/README.md) plugin is also present on the
system, whatever it is activated or not. The CronJobs plugin reuses the jail builder library which is provided by the
InstantSSH plugin to build the jailed environment.

This cron job type doesn't apply to administrators.

#### Full

The full cron jobs are identical to the jailed cron jobs, excepted the fact that the commands are not run in a jailed
environment. Such cron jobs should be reserved to trusted users.

## Crontab files

The plugin handles the crontab files automatically. You must note that any manual change made in a crontab file which is
under the control of this plugin will be automatically overriden on next processing. Therefore, once that a crontab file
is under the control of this plugin, you must use the cronjobs interface provided by this plugin to add, edit or delete
a cron job in this file.

A crontab file is under the control of this plugin as soon as you add a cron task for the user to which it belong to,
through the cronjob interface provided by this plugin.
