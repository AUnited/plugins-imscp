#Â i-mscp cronjobs plugin v0.0.1

plugin implementing a cron time-based job scheduler for i-MSCP.

WARNING: This plugin is still under development, not ready for use

## Introduction

This plugin provide a cron time-based job scheduler for i-MSCP. Administrators give cron permissions to their reseller,
and the resellers give cron permissions to their customers according their own permissions. This is a cascading permissions
level.  For instance a reseller will be able to give the full cronjob permission to a customer only if he has also this
permission.

Administrators can also add their own cron jobs using their own interface. The administrator interface differ from the
customer interface in sense that only administrators can setup the unix user to use for the command execution.

### Cronjob types

Three types of cronjobs are available, which are in order: **Url**, **Jailed** and **Full**.

The jailed cronjob type is available and functional only when the InstantSSH plugin is also installed on the system. Thus,
this is a pre-requirement for use of jailed cronjob types.

#### Url cronjob

This cronjob type allow to schedule commands which are run through Wget. The command must be a valid URL.

#### Jailed cronjob

This cronjob type allow to schedule command which are run through sh,  in a jailed environment. Thus, any needed binary
should be available inside the jail, else, the command will fail. By default the plugin will create a specific jailed
environment which provides Perl, PHP and all the standard commands.

#### Full cronjob

This cronjob type is identical to the jailed cronjob type, excepted the fact that the command is not run in a jailed
environment. Giving to an untrusted customer the permissions to add such a cronjob is not really safe and can lead to
several security issue on your system.
