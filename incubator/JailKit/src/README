DEVELOPERS NOTE
================

Upstream sources modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any change made to the upstream sources should be provided in the imscp.patch
patch, which will be automatically applied during plugin installation.

This mean that you must never do any change on the upstream sources directly.

Note: In near future, the installer will be able to apply multiple patches,
which is the preferable way to provide fixes.

Upstream bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All upstream bugs, which are fixed by the imscp.patch patch should be reported
to the upstream author:

 - https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=jailkit

Note: Only the bugs should be reported. This doesn't not include any i-MSCP
specific change.

Upstream sources update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you must update the upstream sources to a new version, you must ensure that
the imscp.patch patch still apply correctly. In case a fix provided by the
imscp.patch patch has been integrated in the upstream sources, it must be
removed from the patch.
