DEVELOPERS NOTE
================

Upstream sources modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any change made to the upstream sources *must* be provided in the imscp.patch
patch, which is automatically applied on upstream sources during plugin
installation.

This mean that you *must* never do any change on the upstream sources directly.

Note: In near future, the installer will be able to apply multiple patches,
which is the preferable way to provide fixes.

Upstream bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All upstream bugs, which are fixed by the imscp.patch patch *should* be
reported to the upstream author:

 - https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=jailkit

Note: Only the bugs should be reported. This doesn't not include any i-MSCP
specific change (i.e changes made in the *.ini files).

Upstream sources update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you must update the upstream sources to a new version, you *must* ensure
that the imscp.patch patch still apply correctly. In case a fix provided by
the imscp.patch patch has been integrated in the upstream sources, it must
be removed from the patch.

1. Create your working tree
 $ cp -r jailkit jailkit_wrk
