#### 3rd party SpamAssasin Plugins

**DecodeShortURLs**

The [DecodeShortURLs](https://github.com/smfreegard/DecodeShortURLs "DecodeShortURLs") plugin looks 
for URLs shortened by a list of URL shortening services and upon finding a matching URL will connect 
using to the shortening service and do an HTTP HEAD lookup and retrieve the location header which 
points to the actual shortened URL, it then adds this URL to the list of URIs extracted by SpamAssassin 
which can then be accessed by other plugins, such as URIDNSBL.

**iXhash2**

[iXhash2](http://mailfud.org/iXhash2/ "iXhash2") is an unofficial improved version of 
[iXhash](http://www.ixhash.net/ "iXhash") plugin for SpamAssassin, adding async DNS lookups for performance 
and removing unneeded features. It's fully compatible with the iXhash 1.5.5 implementation.	


#### Included Roundcube Plugins

**markasjunk2**

If enabled in the config.php file, the Roundcube plugin markasjunk2 adds a new button to the mailbox toolbar 
to mark the selected messages as 'Junk'/'Not Junk' and will also learn the bayesian database. It will also 
detach original messages from spam reports if the message is not junk.

**sauserprefs**

If enabled in the config.php file, the Roundcube plugin sauserprefs adds a 'Spam' tab to the 'Settings' to 
allow the users to change their SpamAssassin preferences which are stored in the imscp_spamassassin database.
The SpamAssassin preferences shown in Roundcube will vary depending the changes you make in the config.php file.

Roundcube user config: Settings -> Spam


#### Move Spam into Junk folder

If you want to move Spam massages into the users Junk folder, you will need the Roundcube Plugin managesieve, 
which is included in the I-MSCP Plugin RoundcubePlugins.


#### SpamAssassin user preferences

The default SpamAssassin user preferences are stored in the table **userpref** of the **imscp_spamassassin** database.

##### Global SpamAssassin preferences

These are the $GLOBAL default values which will be imported during plugin installation.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>username</th>
		<th>preference</th>
		<th>value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>required_score</td>
		<td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>rewrite_header Subject</td>
		<td>*****SPAM*****</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>report_safe</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>use_bayes</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>use_bayes_rules</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>bayes_auto_learn</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>bayes_auto_learn_threshold_nonspam</td>
		<td>0.1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>bayes_auto_learn_threshold_spam</td>
		<td>12.0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>use_auto_whitelist</td>

		<td>score USER_IN_BLACKLIST</td>
		<td>10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>$GLOBAL</td>
		<td>score USER_IN_WHITELIST</td>
		<td>-6</td>
	</tr>
</table>


The $GLOBAL values will be used as long as the user has no specific entries in the table.
If you want to change some $GLOBAL options, please do that directly in the database.

##### Per-Domain SpamAssassin preferences

You could also specify domain specific entries, which will be used as default only for that domain,
until the user has no individual entry in the userpref table. Here are some examples for the domain **example.com**:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>username</th>
		<th>preference</th>
		<th>value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%example.com</td>
		<td>required_score</td>
		<td>8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%example.com</td>
		<td>rewrite_header Subject</td>
		<td>[ SPAM ]</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%example.com</td>
		<td>report_safe</td>
		<td>0</td>
	</tr>
</table>


##### Per-User SpamAssassin preferences

If you enabled the Roundcube Plugin **sauserprefs** in the config.php file, then the user can change his 
SpamAssassin preferences under Roundcube -> Settings -> Spam.

The user preferences will also be stored in the **userpref** table with the mail address as username.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>username</th>
		<th>preference</th>
		<th>value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>user@example.com</td>
		<td>required_score</td>
		<td>6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>user@example.com</td>
		<td>rewrite_header Subject</td>
		<td>[SPAM-_HITS_]</td>
	</tr>
</table>
