##Â i-MSCP Postscreen plugin v0.0.5

Plugin allows to use Postscreen with Postfix on i-MSCP.

The Postfix Postscreen daemon provides additional protection against mail 
server overload. One Postscreen process handles multiple inbound SMTP 
connections, and decides which clients may talk to a Postfix SMTP server 
process. By keeping spambots away, Postscreen leaves more SMTP server 
processes available for legitimate clients, and delays the onset of server 
overload conditions.

### ATTENTION
	
Please read the [Postfix Postscreen Howto](http://www.postfix.org/POSTSCREEN_README.html "Postfix Postscreen Howto") before installing this plugin.

	If you use this Plugin your MUA clients should not submit mail via SMTP service on TCP port 25 because 
	that is used for the Postscreen daemon with all the checks.
	
	Instead your MUA clients should submit mails via SUBMISSION service on TCP port 587 or via SMTPS service on 
	TCP port 465 which both require client authentication.
