### ATTENTION
	
Please read the [Postfix Postscreen Howto](http://www.postfix.org/POSTSCREEN_README.html "Postfix Postscreen Howto") before installing this plugin.

	If you use this Plugin your MUA clients should not submit mail via SMTP service on TCP port 25 because 
	that is used for the Postscreen daemon with all the checks.
	
	Instead your MUA clients should submit mails via SUBMISSION service on TCP port 587 or via SMTPS service on 
	TCP port 465 which both require client authentication.
